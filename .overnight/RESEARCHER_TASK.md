## Your Mission

Build a complete mental model of this project. Everything downstream (audits, workers,
planners) depends on what you discover here. Be thorough.

## How to Research

Don't follow a rigid checklist. Use intelligence to discover what matters.

### 1. Identify the Project Type

First figure out WHAT this is:
- **Web app** (frontend, backend, or fullstack)?
- **Mobile app** (React Native, Flutter, Swift, Kotlin)?
- **CLI tool** or **library/SDK**?
- **API/backend service**?
- **Monorepo** with multiple packages/apps?
- **Desktop app** (Electron, Tauri)?
- **Static site** or **documentation**?

This determines what audits are relevant later. A CLI tool doesn't need UX_AUDIT.
A library doesn't need MONETIZATION_AUDIT.

### 2. Detect Languages and Tech Stack

Scan the actual files — don't guess:
- **File extensions** — What languages does the source code use? (.py, .ts, .tsx, .go, .rs, .java, .rb, etc.)
- **Dependency manifests** — Read whatever exists: package.json, pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, go.mod, Cargo.toml, Gemfile, pom.xml, build.gradle, composer.json, mix.exs, etc.
- **Build/config files** — tsconfig.json, webpack.config.*, vite.config.*, Makefile, CMakeLists.txt, .cargo/config.toml, setup.py, etc.
- **CI/CD** — .github/workflows/*.yml, .gitlab-ci.yml, Jenkinsfile, .circleci/, Dockerfile
- **Linters/formatters** — .eslintrc, .prettierrc, ruff.toml, .golangci.yml, rustfmt.toml, .editorconfig

### 3. Understand Project Structure

Map the important parts:
- **Entry points** — Where does execution start? (main.py, index.ts, main.go, src/lib.rs, App.tsx, etc.)
- **Source layout** — src/, lib/, internal/, cmd/, apps/, packages/, components/
- **Tests** — Where are they? What framework? How are they run?
- **Config** — Environment files, deployment config, feature flags
- **Monorepo structure** — If multiple apps/packages, map them and their relationships

### 4. Read Project Documentation

Read whatever exists — every project names things differently:
- README.md, CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md
- docs/ or documentation/ directory
- Architecture docs (ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/design/, etc.)
- API docs (OpenAPI specs, route definitions, GraphQL schemas)
- Planning docs (ROADMAP.md, PLAN.md, TODO.md, specs/, etc.)

### 5. Detect Coding Conventions

Workers need to write code that matches the project's style. Detect:
- **Naming style** — snake_case, camelCase, PascalCase for functions/variables/classes
- **Error handling pattern** — Custom error classes? try/catch style? Result types?
- **Import organization** — stdlib first? Grouped? Absolute vs relative?
- **Test patterns** — What framework? Where do tests live? Fixture patterns?
- **Key utilities** — Shared helpers that workers should reuse (e.g., db connection, logger, error class)

Scan 3-5 representative source files to detect patterns. Don't guess — read actual code.

### 6. Identify Current State

- **What works?** — What's clearly implemented and functional?
- **What's broken?** — Build errors, failing tests, obvious issues
- **What's incomplete?** — Stubs, TODOs, skeleton implementations
- **What's the build command?** — How to build and run this project
- **What's the test command?** — How to run tests
